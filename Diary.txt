-Decided project: LS equation:

The student could follow the lecture notes in Ref 33 that will provide
all the needed theoretical equipment to deal with the LS equation.
1. Use the simple potential suggested by M. Hjorth Jensen
2. Look for scattering solutions, you can find lecture and video
here34
3. Look at bound-state solutions, you can find lecture and video
here35
4. (Optional) Use realistic potentials (codes will be sent by email).
With the optional step, the problem could be considered for a two students collaboration project.
