    "# How to renormalize the Schrödinger equation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following notebook I want to repeat the analysis of Lepage described in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-th/9706029. The main idea is that we can apply the idea behind renormalization of field theories - low-energy approximation to arbitrary high-energy physics - even in the context of non-relativistic standard Schrödinger equation. The transformation from the real theory to a simpler effective theory is achieved in two steps. First we introduces a cutoff $\\Lambda$ that is of order of the momentum at which unkown physics becomes important. Obviously we don't know the scale $\\Lambda$ at which this happens but results are almost independent of $\\Lambda$ provided it is much larger then the momenta in the range being probed experimentally. The second step is to add local interactions mimicking the effects of the true short-distance physics. The reason lies in the uncertainty principle: any state involving momentum larger then the cutoff is necessary highly virtual and must occur over distances of order $1/\\Lambda$ or less. In principle there are infinitley manu correction term but, when whorking to a given precision, only a finite number of them are important.\n",
    "At the end only it is only the numerical values of the couplings that contain information about the short-range physics.\n",
    "Before illustrating the construction and use of an effective theory that reproduces a given collection of low-energy data, I discuss the data which are generated inventing a physical system and solving the Schrödinger equation that describes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Synthetic data solving Schrödinger equation\n",
    "For the system we can consider the familiar one-particle Coulombic atom, but with a short-range potentiale $V_S(r)$ in addition to the Coulomb potential:\n",

    "To avoid the problem of divergence at large x the matching method is implemented, so actually two integrations are performed: a forward recursion starting from $0$ and a backward one starting from $x_{\\text{max}}$. The matching point is chosen in correspondence of the classical inversion point $x_{\\text{cl}}$, i.e. where $V(x_{\\text{cl}})$. Before starting the analysis we need to notice another critical aspect of trying to solve straightforwardly the radial equation: the singularity of the potential at $r = 0$.\n",

    "### Logarithmic grid\n",
    "One way to avoide the problem of singularity is to work with a variable-step grid instead of a constant-step one. We can introduce a variable $x$ and a constant-step grid in $x$ sp that we are able to use Numerov's method without changes. Then we define a mapping between $r$ and $x$\n",
